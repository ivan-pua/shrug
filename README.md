# shrug
As part of my COMP2041 university assignment, I have created a clone of Git called **Shrug**.

This Version Control System (VCS) is developed with POSIX Shell.

Shrug is very much like Git, where the usage and semantics mimics Git. For example, `shrug-init` creates an empty repository, just like `git init`. 

* `shrug-init`
* `shrug-add` 
* `shrug-commit`
* `shrug-status`
* `shrug-log`
* `shrug-rm`
* `shrug-show`

Stay tuned for more functions! (e.g. `git merge`, `git checkout`, `git branch`)
